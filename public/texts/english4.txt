Meanwhile they see the mixing bowl, which had been drained so
many times, refilled of its own accord and the wine increasing by
itself. Astonished by the strangeness of the event, they fear, and,
with hands facing upwards, both Baucis and fearful Philemon (begin
to) form prayers and beg pardon for the feast and lack of
preparations. There was just one goose, guardian of the very small
house, which the owners were preparing to kill for the gods, their
guests; the goose, swift with its wings, wore them out as they
were slow through age, eluded them for a long time and finally
seemed to have fled for refuge to the gods themselves. The gods
forbade it to be killed, and said, 'We are gods, and the irreligious
neighbourhood will pay the penalty it deserves; it will be granted to
you to be exempt from this destruction. Just leave your home and
accompany our steps and go together with us to the steep parts of
the mountain.'
