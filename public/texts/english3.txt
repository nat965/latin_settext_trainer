Meanwhile, they while away the intervening hours with
conversations and prevent the delay from being realised. There was
a bathtub there made of beech, suspended from a nail by a sturdy
handle; this is filled with warm water and receives limbs which need
warming. In the middle of the house is a mattress of soft sedge
placed on a bed with a frame and feet made of willow; they cover this
with a coverlet which they were not accustomed to strew over it
except at holiday time, but even this coverlet was both cheap and
ancient, not to be deemed unworthy of the willow couch. The gods
reclined on it.
