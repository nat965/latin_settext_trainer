Therefore, when the heaven dwellers arrived at the small household
and entered the lowly doorposts with lowered head, the old man
ordered them to relax their limbs on a couch which had been set
out for them, over which the busy Baucis placed a rough, woven
cloth. Then she separated the warm ash in the hearth and rouses
yesterday's fires, feeds them with leaves and dry bark, brings forth
flames with the breath of an old woman, and brought down torches
split into many pieces and dry sticks from the roof, made them
smaller and applied them to a small bronze pot; and she strips a
cabbage of its leaves, which her husband had gathered from the
well-watered garden; with a two-pronged fork he lifts the sooty back
of a pig which was hanging on a black beam, cuts off a thin slice from
the long-preserved back and having cut it up, softens it in the
boiling waters.
